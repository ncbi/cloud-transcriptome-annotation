# NOTE: on windows, there's a very strange set of build issues.
#     If you run the VS2008 build, you need to do so as a normal user, or else you get permission errors on the TEMP folder.
#     If you run the VS2015 build, you need to run it from an elevated prompt, or else you get errors like:
#           C:\Program Files
#           (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v14.0\CodeAnalysis\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.targets(219,5):
#           error MSB4036: The "SetEnvironmentVariable" task was not found.
#           Check the following: 1.) The name of the task in the project file is
#           the same as the name of the task class. 2.) The task class is
#           "public" and implements the Microsoft.Build.Framework.ITask
#           interface. 3.) The task is correctly declared with <UsingTask> in
#           the project file, or in the *.tasks files located in the "C:\Program
#           Files (x86)\MSBuild\14.0\bin" directory.
