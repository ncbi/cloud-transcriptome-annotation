  summary: Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python
  description: |
    The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5 on a
    provisional basis and will no longer be provisional in Python 3.7. However,
    this means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be
    able to take advantage of new types added to the typing module, such as
    typing.Text or typing.Coroutine.

    The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes
    as well as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing
    module, such as Protocol.

    Users of other Python versions should continue to install and use the
    typing module from PyPi instead of using this one unless specifically
    writing code that must be compatible with multiple Python versions or
    requires experimental types.
